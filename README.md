This web application displays the weather forecast for any valid location worldwide. It includes features such as:

-Humidity
-Wind Speed

If a user enters an invalid location, the program gracefully displays a "Place not found" error message.

The application is styled using CSS to provide an appealing and responsive design. It includes images and cool background colors to enhance the user experience visually..
